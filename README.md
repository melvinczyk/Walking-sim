# Walking-Sim
 My personal game I am working on

## Features

As this is still a very crude work in progress I want to get the basic movement and collision down before I continue. So far I have implemented the following:

- Basic x and z axis movement
- y axis jumping
- Sprint movement
- Head bob visual on x and y axis
- On ground stopping inertia
- In air stopping Inertia
- Flashlight visual

## Screenshots

Currently there is only one tester stucture made out of assets that I have created on blender

This is the enterance to the structure

This is the main room inside of the structure

## Future plans

 Mainly reworking the current movement system to smooth out the controls and to make the inertia function more like in real life.

 ## Update log

 - Added function to run and jump at same time
 - Added new layers to test map
 - reworked environment
